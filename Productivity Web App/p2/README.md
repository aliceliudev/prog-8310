# Fashion-Outfit-Generator
Tired of just drawing T-shirt and pants? Use this generator and expand your horizons.

This is a generator that will take different styles of clothing parts and combine them together randomly. I made this generator because I noticed I kept gravitating toward drawing the same kinds of outfits everytime I sketched. This generator is to help me create more interesting and exotic outfit combinations. 

I originally made this as a text only generator three years ago on orteil.dashnet but a big problem was that nobody understood what the fashion terms meant without the fashion infographics I had, which made it very frustrating to use.

Now I've redone the entire concept from scratch, allowing the user to see a rough example of what the ensemble parts look like at a glance, not to mention give them the ability to finetune their choice by randomizing indivudual parts or selecting their own favorite from the list.

The images provided in this generator were not made by me but the plan is to eventually replace the images with custom higher quality assets. The images in this generator are from the [Enerie Fashion Vocabulary](https://enerie.wordpress.com) infographics.
